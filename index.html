The Interactive Media Design course offers an in-depth exploration of the multifaceted 
world of digital experiences, where creativity and technology converge to shape how users 
engage with content across various platforms. Throughout the semester, students will 
immerse themselves in the fundamental principles and practices that underpin effective 
interactive design, delving into a wide array of media forms such as websites, 
mobile applications, video games, and immersive installations. This course is structured 
to facilitate a hands-on approach to learning, encouraging students to engage in a series 
of collaborative workshops and individual projects that emphasize the importance of user 
experience (UX) design and interface design. 
                
As students navigate the complexities of interactive media, they will become well-versed 
in critical topics such as design thinking, which encourages a user-centered approach to 
problem-solving, as well as the art of prototyping and user testing, which are essential 
for refining their designs based on real-world feedback. The course will provide students 
with access to industry-standard tools, including Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, and Unity, 
enabling them to translate their innovative ideas into tangible, interactive experiences. 
Moreover, students will be challenged to think critically about the societal implications 
of their designs, examining ethical considerations and the rapidly evolving landscape of 
technology in the realm of interactive media.

            By the conclusion of the course, participants will have amassed a diverse portfolio 
            of work that not only showcases their technical skills and creative vision but also 
            reflects their ability to craft meaningful, user-centered experiences that resonate 
            with audiences. This comprehensive curriculum aims to equip students with both the 
            theoretical knowledge and practical experience necessary to thrive in the dynamic 
            field of interactive media design, fostering a deep appreciation for the ways in 
            which digital interactions can enrich our lives and shape our understanding of the world. 
            Prerequisites for this course include a basic understanding of design principles and some 
            familiarity with digital design tools, ensuring that all students are prepared to embark 
            on this exciting journey into the realm of interactive media.
